==IPv6==
IPv6 has to be set-up manually as of this writing.

What is required is to add an IP to both tap (openvpn) interfaces.
Todo: this should be done via openvpn up scripts.

# add IP to RF interface
ip a add 2a02:6f00:1337:1::1/64 dev tap0

# add IP to DSL interface
ip a add 2a02:6f00:1337:2::1/64 dev tap1
