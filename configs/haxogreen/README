==IPv6==
IPv6 has to be set-up manually as of this writing.

What is required is to add an IP to both tap (openvpn) interfaces, and set-up a route for the subnet we want to route to the camp.

OSPFv3 isn't configured yet, thus we by default configure the route to go over the RF link.


# add IP to RF interface
ip a add 2a02:6f00:1337:1::1/64 dev tap0

# add IP to DSL interface
ip a add 2a02:6f00:1337:2::1/64 dev tap1


# route /56 subnet through (in this case RF) haxogreen router IP
ip -6 r add 2a02:6f00:1337:100::/56 via 2a02:6f00:1337:1::2
